<div class="abcd"> From the eighth grade I started to get involved in programming because of my computer science teachers, in the ninth grade I planned to enter the cybersecurity specialty. When I moved to Astana (in the second half of 2018), I started to like this topic related to programming even more, and I began to prepare for entering universities specifically for specialties related to IT. </div>

<div class="abcd"> I have been playing Dota since 2015, during this period of time, I realized that I am pleased to play as a support. At the moment, I am among the 1 percent of players in the world by rating (at the moment, out of four million players). I also want to note that now I play for the university Dota team. </div>

<h1> Anime </h1>
<IMG SRC = "anime.jpg" ALT = "There must be a picture" HEIGHT = 350 WIDTH = 280 ALIGN = middle ISMAP> </IMG>
<div class="abcd"> I really enjoy watching anime, more than serials and films, because in my opinion, anime can be realized more opportunities than filming. Below I will provide you with my top anime. By the way, because of the anime, I came up with the nickname SadSkyYyy </div>
